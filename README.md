<p>Why do this?</p>
<p>Because I think it's cool.  Do I need a better reason?</p>
<br/>
<p>Tell me about the tech.</p>
<p>This project is written in AngularJS 1.... Poorly.  Honestly, this is a rapid prototype as the kick starter only lasts so long.</p>
<p>Let's talk through design.  There are the following components to an individual tile in a map:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which segment?</li>
<li>Where is the segment located?</li>
<li>Which way is the segment facing?</li>
</ul>
<p>So... Not that complicated. In other words, there are 3 variables for each tile in a matrix of tiles.</p>
<p>So let's take a moment to think through some more interesting features.  I think that people would be interested in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a cool looking mat out of the Terminus Segments.</li>
<li>Which pack containss which tile?</li>
<li>Some mechanism for the optimum purchase to get everything you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two are kinda easy.  It's the last one that gets difficult, but is solvable.</p>
